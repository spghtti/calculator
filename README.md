# calculator
Final project for The Odin Project's Foundations course. Heavily inspired by the stock iPhone calculator design because that's what I had on hand and I dig round buttons.

This ended up being a lot more difficult than I imagined but I learned a lot. Still a work-in-progress yet I'm really satisfied with how this came out.
