# calculator
This is my final project for The Odin Project's Foundations course. Heavily inspired by the stock iPhone calculator design because that's what I had on hand and I dig round buttons.

This ended up being a lot more difficult than I imagined but I learned a lot. Turns out there's _a lot_ more to calculators than just mapping functions to buttons. But overall I'm really satisfied with how this one came together.
